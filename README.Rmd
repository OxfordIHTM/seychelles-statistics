This repository is a [`docker`](https://www.docker.com/get-started)-containerised, [`{targets}`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/)-based, [`{renv}`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html)-enabled [`R`](https://cran.r-project.org/) workflow for the `seystats` project on curating Seychelles data and statistics from various publicly-available sources.

## About the project

In 2022, the **Seychelles-Oxford Partnership** on research capacity building leveraged the vast research experience and skills of University of Oxford research partners for training and upskilling data analysts from the Ministry of Health (MOH) Seychelles.

From this process, the partnership identified that while the Seychelles is one of the few sub-Saharan African countries with efficient, accurate, and comprehensive data collection and disaggregation across a variety of sectors and across a variety of metrics, most of this data are not in the format, shape, and structure that are ready for analysis. A good amount of these rich data are still on paper or ledgers. For the data that are electronic, they are either stored/distributed in formats that are not readily readable by machines for analysis (e.g., portable document format or PDF) or are in proprietary spreadsheet format (i.e. Microsoft Excel) structured into presentational tables meant for reports rather than for actual analysis.

It is from this context that the initial ideas and motivation around this project began. The partnership involves mostly individuals whose roles and responsibilities were related to health. As such, ad hoc plans prioritised health-related data. During this time, rough and informal plans were drawn as to how the various steps will be implemented and how the different technologies required will be resourced. Alongside these, ongoing capacity-building on data management and analysis related to research continued within the partnership.

By 2025, three years on from the start of the partnership, very little has progressed and has been implemented from these informal, ad hoc plans whilst the partnership continued to more research capacity-building focusing on other types of research skills (e.g. qualitative research), on student placement projects for University of Oxford Masters students, and other research efforts (e.g. cancer screening, cancer awareness, cancer quality-of-care). During this period and in all these activities, the same challenges and issues related to data identified in 2022 keep propping up.

It is within this background that the `seystats` project is being (re-)launched. The current motivation is to try to get moving in a more productive direction on the ideas generated in 2022 and to be able to demonstrate the stated advantages of data that is accessible, persistent, and machine-readable/machine-actionable to catalysing research efforts in Seychelles.

## Current sources of data

The project uses only officially-released publicly-available sources of data on Seychelles. Such data are primarily sourced from Seychelles government websites either as file downloads or data embedded onto the webpages themselves. Other sources are official government publications not released online.

Currently, the available datasets from `seystats` are from the Seychelles [National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)](https://www.nbs.gov.sc/) which provides [downloads](https://www.nbs.gov.sc/downloads) of various official statistics for/about Seychelles. This current release includes data from the [NBS Statistical Bulletin on Population and Vital Statistics](https://www.nbs.gov.sc/downloads/).

## Current available datasets

The currently available datasets from the `seystats` project are listed and described in the table below.

```{r echo = FALSE}
data_file_name <- list.files("data")

data_title <- c(
  "Registered births by age of mother and birth order",
  "Registered births by age of mother and mother's district of residence",
  "Registered births by age of mother",
  "Registered births by birth order",
  "Registered births by mother's district of residence",
  "Registered births by month of birth registration",
  "Registered births by sex of child",
  "Registered births total",
  "Registered deaths by age and sex",
  "Registered deaths of infants total",
  "Registered deaths total",
  "Population midyear by age and sex",
  "Population midyear by age",
  "Population midyear by district of residence",
  "Population midyear total"
)

data_interval <- c(rep("Yearly", 5), "Monthly", rep("Yearly", 9))

data_url <- paste0(
  "[file](", 
  file.path(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OxfordIHTM/seystats/refs/heads/main/data",
    data_file_name
  ),
  ")"
)

data.frame(data_title, data_interval, data_file_name, data_url) |>
  knitr::kable(
    col.names = c("Description", "Time Interval", "Filename", "Data URL")
  )
```

All available datasets can be found in the `data` folder of this repository. Other modes of distribution (e.g. Dolthub SQL database, Zenodo, Figshare, etc.) are currently in development and would be available soon.

## Accessing the datasets

The datasets curated by `seystats` can be accessed through the following methods:

### Forking and then cloning the project repository

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) a copy of the project repository into your own GitHub account then [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your copy of the project repository into your local machine. This requires a GitHub account and knowledge of git processes. This approach will give you a copy of the entire repository of which the `data` directory contains all the datasets listed above. This approach would be ideal for those who would like to access the datasets but also would like to potentially contribute to the source code for the curation of the datasets.

### Manually download from GitHub

Go to the project repository, then to the `data` directory and then select and click the dataset CSV file you want to download. On the upper right hand corner you will see an downward pointing arrow icon. Click on this icon to download the selected dataset CSV file.

### Programmatically download from GitHub

Using the data URL indicated in the table above, one can programmatically download the dataset of interest using your choice of programming tool.

In Terminal:

```bash
curl -OL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OxfordIHTM/seystats/refs/heads/main/data/births_by_age.csv
```

In R:

```R
download.file(
  url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OxfordIHTM/seystats/refs/heads/main/data/births_by_age.csv"
  destfile = "data/births_by_age.csv"
)
```
In the release version of `seystats`, we will be distributing the datasets in repositories and archives that have more straightforward user interfaces for downloading the datasets.

## Repository Structure

The project repository is structured as follows:

```
seystats
    |-- .git-crypt/
    |-- .github/
    |-- auth/
    |-- data/
    |-- maps/
    |-- outputs/
    |-- pdf/
    |-- R/
    |-- renv
    |-- reports
    |-- schema/
    |-- _targets.R
    |-- .env
    |-- .gitattributes
    |-- .Rprofile
    |-- packages.R
    |-- renv.lock
```

* `.git-crypt/` contains `git-crypt` software specific files to manage encryption of specific files and folders in the repository.  

* `.github` contains project testing and automated deployment of outputs workflows via continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) using Github Actions.

* `auth` contains encrypted authentication keys used in this workflow.

* `data/` contains comma-separated value (CSV) files of the various datasets curated by the project.

* `maps/` contains Seychelles map data files downloaded by the workflow.

* `outputs/` contains compiled reports and figures produced by the workflow.

* `pdf/` contains PDF files downloaded by the workflow for data extraction.

* `R/` contains R functions developed/created specifically for use in this project.

* `renv/` contains `renv` package specific files and directories used by the package for maintaining R package dependencies within the project. The directory `renv/library`, is a library that contains all packages currently used by the project. This directory, and all files and sub-directories within it, are all generated and managed by the `renv` package. Users should not change/edit these manually.

* `reports/` contains literate code for R Markdown and/or Quarto reports rendered in the workflow.

* `schema/` contains `.sql` code used for creating and deploying the project SQL database in DoltHub.

* `_targets.R` file defines the steps in the workflow's data ingest, data processing, data outputs, and reporting pipeline.

* `.env` is an encrypted file that contains environment variables used in this project.

* `.gitattributes` file contains information used by `git-crypt` to determine which files and/or folders in the repository to encrypt.

* `.Rprofile` file is a project R profile generated when initiating `renv` for the first time. This file is run automatically every time R is run within this project, and `renv` uses it to configure the R session to use the `renv` project library.

* `packages.R` file lists out and loads all R package dependencies required by the workflow.

* `renv.lock` file is the `renv` lockfile which records enough metadata about every package used in this project that it can be re-installed on a new machine. This file is generated by the `renv` package and should not be changed/edited manually.

## Reproducibility

### R version

This project is built using `R 4.5.1`. To manage R versions, it is recommended to use [`rig`](https://github.com/r-lib/rig) - an R installation manager - to be able to install multiple versions of R and switch between them as needed.

### R package dependencies

This project uses the `{renv}` framework to record R package dependencies and versions. Packages and versions used are recorded in `renv.lock` and code used to manage dependencies is in the `renv` directory and other files in the root project directory.

On starting an R session in the working directory of this repository, first run 

```R
renv::restore()
```

to install R package dependencies. This is only done once when the project is being initiated for the first time by a user.

### Encryption

This project uses encrypted environment variables and authentication keys for data retrieval managed using [`git-crypt`](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt). Collaborators will need to [install `git-crypt`](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt) and then provide their GPG key to the authors to be added as an authorised user within the repository. To get a GPG key, [download and install GPG](https://www.gnupg.org/download/) and then [generate your GPG key pair](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/c14.html). Then provide your GPG key id to the authors.

Once given permission into the project and GPG key id added to the repository, update your local version of the repository by doing a `git pull` and then unlock the encrypted files/folders of the repository by running the following command in Terminal from within the project directory:

```bash
git-crypt unlock
```

The encrypted components of the repository will now be decrypted and accessible for running the workflow (described below).

### The workflow

The current workflow has the following steps:

```{r full-workflow, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
cat(
  c(
    "```mermaid",
    targets::tar_mermaid(
      targets_only = TRUE, outdated = FALSE, legend = FALSE, color = FALSE
    ),
    "```"
  ),
  sep = "\n"
)
```

To run the workflow, issue the following command in R from within the project directory

```R
targets::tar_make()
```

or issue the following command in Terminal from within the project directory

```bash
Rscript -e  "targets::tar_make()"
```
